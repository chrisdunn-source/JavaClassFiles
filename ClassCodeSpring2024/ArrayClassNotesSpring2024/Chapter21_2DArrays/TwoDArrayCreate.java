    An Array Inside Another Array
    An array inside another array is called a 2D array.
    A 2D arrays is symbolic of a table where there are rows and columns.
    The first index number represents the row position and the
    second index number represents the column position. Together, the row and column
    indices enable elements to be stored at specific locations.

        thatâ€™s at row index 1 and column index 2.

        Row-Major vs. Column-Major Order
        In some cases, programmers may choose to store 2D array data inside a 1D array.
        The data is typically arranged either in row-major order or column-major order.

        Examples:
        2D Array Example:
        {Alan, Bob, Carol, David, Ellen}
        {Fred, Grace, Henry, Ian, Jen}
        {Kelly, Liam, Mary, Nancy, Owen}

        Row-major order will organize the data first from left to right then top to bottom.
        {Alan, Bob, Carol, David, Ellen, Fred, Grace, Henry, Ian, Jen, Kelly, Liam, Mary, Nancy, Owen}


        On the other hand, column-major order will organize the data from top to bottom first, then left to right.
        {Alan, Fred, Kelly, Bob, Grace, Liam, Carol, Henry, Mary, David, Ian, Nancy, Ellen, Jen, Owen}
